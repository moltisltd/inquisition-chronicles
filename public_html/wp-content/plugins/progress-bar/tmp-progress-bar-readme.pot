msgid "This determines how full the progress bar will be. Progress can be in 2 forms, either a number (0-100), in which case it will be interpreted as a percentage, or as a fraction (e.g. 25/100). Since 1.1, you can also use dollar signs (e.g. $63/$180), for example to create a fundraising progress bar. If using dollar signs, you only <em>need</em> to add a dollar sign to one or the other of the two values (e.g. 63/$180 or $63/180) -- the plugin will output either option the same ($63/$180). Your progress can go over, too (e.g. 150/100 or 123%), but your mileage may vary for the display. It's not recommended to use this with the <strong>fullwidth</strong> option, for example, because your progress will spill outside of your main body container."
